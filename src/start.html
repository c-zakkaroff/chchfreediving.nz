        <p>Freediving with a club means you can train regularly and find other divers for trips or competitions. It's a great way to give freediving a try in a safe and friendly environment, and it's cheap too.</p>
        <p>To join Christchurch Freediving Club, everyone needs to attend an induction (you can attend the induction without joining the club, if you just want to give it a go). We hold inductions monthly, 6pm till 8pm on a Monday at Graham Condon swimming pool. You'll need to fill in the forms below before attending. We'll get back to you with the date of the next available induction. Inductions are usually $20, but are free for our first few months. After your induction you can train with us for the rest of the month before you need to join the club, and we deduct the price of the induction from your first year's fees. If you've got any questions, <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a>!</p>
        <p>You must be 18 or older, in general good health, and comfortable in the water (you don't need to be Michael Phelps, but you do need to be able to swim a few lengths and be comfortable going underwater). You'll need to bring the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mask</li>
          <li>Fins (you don't need freediving fins, any fins will do)</li>
          <li>Wetsuit (not strictly necessary, but you'll get very cold without. A swimming/triathalon wetsuit is best, but any wetsuit will do)</li>
          <li>Weight belts and weights, or neck weight</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you're missing anything, let us know and we might be able to help out.</p>
        <p>We recommend that anyone who freedives (especially in open water) take a course from a qualified instructor, but it's not a prerequisite for joining the club.</p>
