    "text": "<img src=\"assets/lane-sign.jpg\" alt=\"Lane reserved sign\">\n<p>On Monday this week, we had our first ever training session! We ran a 'sort-of' induction for three new members - due to covid level 2 we couldn't practice any rescues, etc. We covered some theory and practiced dynamics, and we'll hopefully do the rescues next week so they can fully participate. We also managed some regular training, and I got my monofin on for the first time in months (maybe a year?).</p>\n<p>We'll be training every Monday from 6:30 at Graham Condon. If you want to join us, we'll be running inductions each month, sign up on the <a href=\"start.html\">start</a> page.</p>\n<img src=\"assets/first-training.jpg\" alt=\"Club members and inductees at training\">"
