This provides numerous benefits to our members including being able to compete in AIDA competitions and being eligible for national records.</p>\n<p>The club now also has approval from the council to train static apnea in the pools and subject to demand and lane availability we will be running a weekly session focused on statics. This adds another dimension to our training sessions and particularly useful for those wishing to enter competitions or focus on their relaxation technique.</p>\n<h2>Training update</h2>\n<p>Now that we are back down to Alert Level 2 we are back to our regulary weekly training at Graham Condon Pool on Mondays from 6:30pm and Wednesdays from 7:30pm. Make sure to join our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/christchurchfreediving\">facebook page</a> to keep up to date with the latest information. We will also be running our next club induction on <strong>Monday 27th September</strong> from 6:00pm. If you wish to attend please register your interest by completing the <a href=\"start.html#induction\">induction form</a> and we will be in touch.</p>"
