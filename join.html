        <p>We love new members! Whether you're brand new to the sport and want to try it out, or super-experienced and want to train for your next competition, you'll be welcome to join the club.</p>
        <p>Everyone has to attend an induction, even if you've been diving for years, you've taken a course, or you're a member of another club, see our <a href="join.html">joining page</a>.</p>
        <p>Once you've done an induction, you can join the club. You'll need to fill out the membership form below and pay the club fees. Our fees are $100 per calendar year or $10 per month for the remainder of a year. Then you can attend our <a href="train.html">training sessions</a>, trips, and other events.</p>
        <p>Joining the club will make you a member of Freediving New Zealand which means you can enter AIDA competitions (we're in the process of affiliating with FNZ, so this benefit doesn't apply quite yet).</p>
